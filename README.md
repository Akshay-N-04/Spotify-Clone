# Spotify-Clone
As part of learning to code, I am building a  project that involves creating a basic Spotify clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was designed to showcase my skills in front-end web development. It is a responsive and user-friendly web application that allows users to play music. I used HTML and CSS to design and style the interface.
